# Overview
The task is about interfacing two PIC controllers with each other through implementing a UART Protocol. In the PIC microcontroller there is an internal hardware which implements the UART protocol but to learn UART protocol from scratch we will start Implementing the protocol manually (without using internal dedicated hardware or software serial libraries). Then in further sub tasks we will be switching to communicate two MCUs using internal hardware in order to learn using internal hardware functioning and usage from datasheet
